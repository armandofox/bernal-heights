Feature: administrator login

  As an administrator of Bernal Heights Community Center,
  I want to login 
  So that I can moderate events and view hotspot form submissions.

#need to fill in correct acct info and need to add privilege granting step
  #Given I am on the sign in page
  #When I follow "Sign in with Google"
  #Then I should be on the Google Login page
  #When I fill in "email" with "admin1@google.com"
  #And I fill in "password" with "admin1password"
  #And I press "Sign in"
  #Then I should be on the admin home page
  #And I should see "Welcome, admin1"
